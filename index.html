  <section id="about">
    <p>
      I'm a Computer Science professional with proven success in management, team leadership and technical support,
      highly fluent in English and Spanish.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since November 2023, I have been engaged as an independent contractor, specializing in website development,
      web API and web services implementation, digital project management, software quality assurance, technical
      documentation writing and translation, and related projects. Alongside these efforts, I have been actively
      improving my programming skills and expanding my computer knowledge. All this by leveraging a strong foundation
      in IT principles, programming languages, problem-solving skills, and a passion for creating innovative solutions.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am eager to connect with others and look forward to potential collaborations.
